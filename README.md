# Data Science and Machine Learning Portfolio
## by Rose-Marie Patrick

This page highlights my collection of Data Science and Machine Learning Projects that I have done to learn/practice different techniques in the field. Click the links under each heading to see the code repositories for each project.

## Distracted Driver Detection
The aim of this project is given the dataset of driver images, each taken in a car with a driver doing something in the car (texting, eating, talking on the phone, makeup, reaching behind, etc), predict the likelihood of what the driver is doing in each picture. The data set was taken from the Kaggle - State Farm Distracted Driver.

## Mini-Projects
Small projects I completed during the completion of my certificate program in Machine Learning Engineering. These projects are in Jupyter Notebooks.

### Data Collection
This mini project focuses on equities data from the Frankfurt Stock Exhange (FSE), which is available on Quandl. Data collection and analysis was completed on the stock prices of Carl Zeiss Meditec, which manufactures tools for eye examinations, as well as medical lasers for laser eye surgery. The company is listed under the stock ticker AFX_X. This project also explores the use of Python libraries *requests* and *json*.

### Data Wrangling (Pandas and Spark)
Data wrangling and transformation using Pandas and an IMDB dataset.

A short exercise to become more familiar with the JSON format and data wrangling.

### Machine Learning Algorithms
#### Linear Regression
This mini-project focuses on linear regression. The Boston Housing data set contains information about the housing values in suburbs of Boston. This dataset was originally taken from the StatLib library which is maintained at Carnegie Mellon University and is now available on the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The packages used are *statsmodels*, *seaborn*, and *scikit-learn*. The notebook goes through some exploratory data analysis before fitting linear regression models with statsmodels and sklearn.
