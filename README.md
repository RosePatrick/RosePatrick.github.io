## Data Science and Machine Learning Portfolio
This page highlights my collection of Data Science and Machine Learning Projects that I have done to learn/practice different techniques in the field. Click the links under each heading to see the code repositories for each project.

### Distracted Driver Detection
The aim of this project is given the dataset of driver images, each taken in a car with a driver doing something in the car (texting, eating, talking on the phone, makeup, reaching behind, etc), predict the likelihood of what the driver is doing in each picture. The data set was taken from the Kaggle - State Farm Distracted Driver.

### Mini-Projects
Small projects I completed during the completion of my certificate program in Machine Learning Engineering. These projects are in Jupyter Notebooks.
